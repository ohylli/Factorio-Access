Version: 0.10.1
Date: 2024.04.13

  Summary:
    - This update comes after some restructuring of the mod repository and joining the official Factorio Mod Portal. Note that releases still need to be installed from the GitHub page because of the launcher and config changes required to run the mod properly. The update itself includes tweaks, additions, and bugfixes across the board thanks to community feedback. Notably, several blueprint bugs have been fixed and Remote View has been added.

  Info:
    - The mod's GitHub repository has been moved to a new address to make contributions easier: https://github.com/Factorio-Access/FactorioAccess. Hyperlinks to it have been automatically updated.

    - The mod's wiki has been moved to this address as well, and hyperlinks to it have been updated manually. You may need to update your own wiki related browser bookmarks.

    - The mod has now been officially added to the Factorio Mod Portal, but please note that downloading and installing it from the portal does not make it playable. You still need to use the mod launcher for vocalization and also making game configuration changes to accommodate this mod. Therefore please use the GitHub releases page and follow the install instructions.

    -Release folder contents now include mod dependency info and a mod portal compatible changelog, which is what prompted formatting changes for the main changelog.

    -Settings for configuring other mods are now updated using data stage code, as it should be. Meanwhile, the feature for in-game settings changing is still being worked on.

  Features:
    - Added Remote View, which is when the camera and microphone focuses on the player's cursor instead of the player's character. Press "ALT + I" to toggle it.
      * Press arrow keys to move the cursor in remote view. Do not use the "W" "A" "S" "D" keys because this makes the camera pan too fast in a way we cannot control.
      * This view allows focusing on distant locations, although blurred or uncharted areas offer limited info and no sounds. You need to keep them fully loaded using radars.
      * Remote view automatically opens and closes Cursor Mode along with itself.
      * For now, most sounds are muffled in remote view, but this will be fixed. 

    - Added basic support for the Kruise Kontrol mod, which allows automatic walking to the cursor location.
      * Press "CONTROL + ALT + RIGHT BRACKET" twice, to first open the cursor location in remote view, and then to instruct an action.
      * Usually the action is to walk or drive to that spot. Special cases include selecting a resource to start mining it, selecting a ghost to start building them, selected a descontruction marked building to start removing them, selecting trees to start chopping them, and selecting enemies to start fighting them.
      * Press "ENTER" to cancel ongoing actions. Some actions may be unclear at times so this is recommended if things are taking to long.
      * The character cuts trees along their automatic walking paths.

    - The pollution level at the cursor position can now be read, by pressing "SHIFT + U". Note that "high" pollution is usually when trees start taking pollution damage. Other than that, the most important thing to track regarding pollution is how heavily polluted enemy spawners are, which can be checked with the scanner tool.

    - The scanner can now locate the nearest damaged entity of the player's own team, by pressing "SHIFT + P". This has a range limit of 1000 tiles.

  Changes:
    -Launcher: Changed the description of the Compass Valley preset to make it more beginner friendly.

    -Cursor area scanning now reports coverage percentages only for ground tiles. It also notes whether there are other things in the area after listing the first 4 things.

    -Cursor area scanning now updates the scan result list properly so that the list can be used to examine in detail what is within the area.

    -Cursor size options now include 51 by 51.

    -Minor revisions were made in some tutorial steps for clarity.

    -Checking technology info now also reads the localised description of the technology. Technology required ingredient names have been localised too.

    -Alternate controls for SCAN-UP and SCAN-DOWN have been changed to "ALT + UP" and "ALT + DOWN". The main controls are still "PAGEUP" and "PAGEDOWN".

  Bugfixes:
    -Fixed a mod initialization crash that was preventing it from running on dedicated servers.

    -Removed deprecated cursor release keybind, which was interfering with rail analysis.

    -Fixed the incorrect reporting of blueprint dimensions from inside the blueprint menu.

    -Fixed a crash during the re-selection of blueprints with no names or descriptions.

    -Fixed a crash during the reading of blueprints with invalid items or icons in them, such as old science pack versions.

    -Fixed the ambiguity about the "electronics" technology having no direct unlocks.

    -Fixed the input for locking 5 inventory slots of chests.

    -Fixed some mod menu typos.

Version: 0.10.0
Date: 2024.04.06

  Summary:
    - This update features a full rewrite of the mod tutorial to include new chapters and details. Please note that the new tutorial may need more tweaking despite being reviewed, so feel free to get in touch about issues or suggestions. The update also has some launcher improvements such as mod management, as well as small additions and changes to improve the early game, and some changes thanks to community feedback.
    - Note: Earlier changelog entries use a different format and thus are not automatically loaded.

  Features:
    -The tutorial has been rewritten, doubling in length. The game should now be more accessible to new players.
      * There are now 12 chapters covering everything up to producing logistic science packs, and general tips chapter at the end.
      * There is a total of over 300 steps in total, with generally only 1 or 2 instructions per step.
      * Recently added features such as blueprints, cursor skipping, and steam engine snapping have been included.
      * If you had started the tutorial before this update, jumping back to its start is recommended so that you can reset to the new version and then skip doing the steps that you have already covered. You can jumping back to the start by pressing "ALT + SHIFT + H" a few times.
      * The tutorial needs further testing and will continue to receive minor tweaks. Experienced players are invited to give it a try as well, for review assistance.

    - New launcher version, with the following additions and changes:
      * Added a mod management menu, for other mods. You can now enable or disable other mods here so that you no longer need to delete a mod to remove it.
      * Saving the game now plays beeps at the start and end of it, instead of speaking a message that interrupts other speech.
      * The launcher now loads much faster.
      * Fixed a bug so that a missing translation key returns English text instead of an error.

    - Added steam engine snapped building.
      * Press "CONTROL + LEFT BRACKET" with a steam engine in hand to try automatically building a correctly positioned steam engine next to the first free boiler found within 25 tiles.
      * Mainly added because when you first need steam engines in the first hours of the game you are still new to building.
      * Does not snap to anything else.
      * You still need to clear the building area manually, inlcuding stepping out of the way.

    - You can now read the cursor position distance as a vector from the character position by pressing "ALT + K".
      * This reports the vertical and horizontal distances separately, without giving an average compass direction.
      * This information is useful for building belts and pipes because you'll get the exact distances to cover since they cannot connect to each other diagonally.

    - A selected fluid in a building can now be permanently flushed away by pressing "X".

  Changes:
    - Autosaving now makes two click sounds in the background to signal its start and end, instead of interrupting speech output.

    - Reading a tile now also comments about its visibility information.
      * An uncharted tile is labelled as so. You cannot know what is there and it might not even be generated yet.
      * A charted tile that is more than about 100 tiles away from the nearest player or powered radar is blurred by the game, and it is now also labelled as so. A blurred area has minimal information about what is happening there and produces no sounds even though machines continue to work and enemies continue to move. Tile blurring affects some but not all remote interactions, and sighted players prefer to spread radars around to keep most factory areas continuously visible.
      * For a camera centered on the player, which is the default case, a tile that is outside the camera view is outside the rendered screen area and is now labelled as "distant". This affects some actions involving remote controls, although we have tried to minimize the dependency on doing things on screen. You can use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out, which changes camera coverage.

    - The tutorial now gifts one stack of coal as part of your emergency supply kit that is already provided at the start of the game. This is important for teaching game mechanics in a clean order. This gift switched from rocket fuel to coal in order to simplify the process and not offer a significant advantage.

    - Steam engine direction reporting now says "north and south", or "east and west", to acknowledge that the building is symmetrical.

    - A selected water tile is now labelled as "open" or "shore" or "crevice", depending on the arrangement of other water tiles around it.

    - A pipe end is now identified as a special case where a pipe has less than 2 connections. This is worth noting because it means the pipe does not lead to anything.

    - Pipe ends are now distinguished from other pipes in the scanner list.

    - Pipes and storage tanks are now distinguished in the scanner list by the fluid contained.

    - Storage tanks are now categorized as containers in the scanner list.

    - When you successfully build a pipe to ground unit, the building direction in hand is flipped 180 degrees so that the other end can be built quickly.

    - The pipe to ground building preview now also reports information about the above ground connection preview.

    - Removed unnecessary repetition of "per cycle" when listing recipe ingredients.

    - Checking the status of an enemy spawner now reveals the enemy evolution factor.

    - Tweaked names of curved rail and diagonal rail directions to improve clarity.

    - Removed the default descriptions from science packs and modules so that the mod's custom descriptions would apply.

  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed incorrect reporting of player weapons when you switch a vehicle weapon.
      * Note: Reading out the correct vehicle weapon has not been added yet.

    - If the pipe to ground preview finds multiple successful underground connections, the closest one is now taken, which is the correct case.

    - Fixed a localisation error for when you start crafting a recipe.

    - Fixed self-interrupting reminders at the start of the game.
